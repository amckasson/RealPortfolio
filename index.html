            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I have a diverse work background.  I've done various sales jobs, and worked in Restaurants doing both front and back of house work.
                In April of 2021 I wanted to make a professional change.  Earlier my job in the restaurant industry had been taken by the pandemic. Though I really 
                enjoyed what I was doing, having my job taken away was hard. I wanted to get into an industry with a little more flexibility.  I then found out about Eleven Fifty Academy.
            </p>
            <p>When I was accepted into Eleven Fifty Academy I chose the Software Developer path.  It's focus is on teaching C#; it also goes over some HTML and CSS.  That's 
                what I used to create this page.
            </p>
            <p>My goal is to use my personal and professional skills to begin my journey working in the field of technology.  I love technology; learning about it through 
                personal use and study.  I think it's an incredibly exciting field with limitless opportunity.  I plan on continuing my learning with more languages as well as 
                gaining some certificates in whatever fields intrest me such as AZURE cloud services.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for stopping by and checking out my portfolio.  Feel free to come back as I plan on continuing to make changes; as well as adding more projects.  You can find 
                them beside this blurb, feel free to click on them and check them out.
